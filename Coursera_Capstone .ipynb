    "Road traffic injuries are a major but neglected public health challenge that requires concerted efforts for effective and sustainable prevention. Of all the systems with which people have to deal every day, road traffic systems are the most complex and the most dangerous. Worldwide, an estimated 1.2 million people are killed in road crashes each year and as many as 50 million are injured. Projections indicate that these figures will increase by about 65% over the next 20 years unless there is new commitment to prevention. Nevertheless, the tragedy behind these figures attracts less mass media attention than let´s say, Corona Virus for instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With these statements in mind, the aim of this project is to establish which variables are more influential to causing severe road  accidents, other than the obvious candidates like speeding or DUI´s, which in my opinion have been thoroughly studied in the past. There are many other factors in play that could cause an accident like weather or light conditions, condition of the pavement and so on. The base of this investigation is to determine whether these external factors are as influential to accident causation as the driver´s behavior behind the wheel. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though there are many dataset available in Kaggle in terms of road accidents, I couldn´t find any other set that had the variables I wanted to include in my analysis, specifically road and light conditions, as well as the coordinates of the accidents to determine if there are stretches on the road systems where accidents are more likely to happen that in others.\n"
